## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", "English")

str(activity)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}

# 1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
StepsPerDay <- aggregate(activity$steps, list(activity$date), FUN=sum)
colnames(StepsPerDay) <- c("Date", "Steps")
StepsPerDay

# 2. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
g <- ggplot(StepsPerDay, aes(Steps))
g+geom_histogram(boundary=0, binwidth=2500, col="darkgreen", fill="lightgreen")+ggtitle("Histogram of steps per day")+xlab("Steps")+ylab("Frequency")+theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold", size=12))+scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,25000,2500))+scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,18,2))

# 3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

# Mean
mean(StepsPerDay$Steps, na.rm=TRUE)

#Median
median(StepsPerDay$Steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
